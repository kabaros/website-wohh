description: "To marshal the resources of the Sudanese Diaspora to build the
  capacity and resilience of disaster prone and affected communities and help
  muster their inherent capacities and initiative to overcome their
  after-effects and safeguard against future external shocks. We, A HEART FOR
  SUDAN, a group in the Diaspora of concerned Sudanese from United Kingdom,
  United States, Australia and Sudan are announcing the launch of our Project
  Rebuild organisation, a civil society initiative, aimed at rebuilding lives
  and communities in Sudan in the wake of the devastating floods that
  overwhelmed the country this past rainy season. It has been a disaster that
  blighted many lives and uprooted families and shattered entire communities,
  and its ripple effects are likely to seed long-term and far-reaching endemic
  economic and health consequences, which can only be averted by the concerted
  assistance, and targeted programmes of local capacity-building, up-skilling
  and the transfer of appropriate knowledge and technologies. Although there are
  excellent efforts already underway by Sudanese working abroad, providing much
  needed financial support for those affected, Project Rebuild seeks to go
  beyond traditional models for disaster relief and assistance for our people.
  Project Rebuild initiative will focus on developing programmes and
  interventions that seeks structural solutions to our disaster-ridden and
  fragile communities back home. It is a method of assistance, which aims to
  provide the tools for and the means to those communities to develop skills and
  knowledge locally to avert disasters and deal with their its aftermaths. And
  this we intend to foster through targeted skill and knowledge transfer and the
  building the local capacities to withstand natural disasters and external
  shocks. Our ultimate aim is bolstering the local communities’ resilience and
  to develop their capacity to utilize the combined resources of local wisdom,
  social capital, emergency aid and financial assistance efficiently,
  sustainably with the minimum external encroachment and intrusion. Our
  engagement model will be based on working in accord with the self-activity and
  local initiative where local grass roots participation and feedback in project
  development and implementation is a key measure of success. We call upon all
  Sudanese abroad to join us in this noble effort, particularly those who have
  the means, skills and the spare time to help. What you can do, at present, to
  help. Contact us with: -Your contact details to register your interest to be
  part of this initiative. - Urge qualified young people in your family or group
  of friends also to join. - If you live in Sudan indicate your interest to
  volunteer for this initiative. - Pledge your readiness to contribute
  financially to the initiative. - Pledge your readiness to organise events to
  promote the work of the initiative. - Pledge your readiness to work as a
  volunteer of with affected communities in Sudan."
